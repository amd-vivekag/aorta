"""``aorta env`` - thin CLI wrapper around :func:`collect_env`.

The library function in :mod:`aorta.instrumentation.environment` does all
the probing; this module only handles arg parsing and writing the JSON
snapshot to disk. Per #147 acceptance: this file does no probing of its
own and stays under ~30 lines of substantive code (excluding the
docstring above).
