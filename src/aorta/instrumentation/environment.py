"""``aorta env probe`` implementation (issue #147).

Library-first per the updated A1 spec: the primary deliverable is

* ``collect_env() -> EnvSnapshot``

which B1 (per-trial runner) and B2 (matrix runner) call **in-process** so
every trial / matrix run records its environment without shelling out.
``aorta env probe`` (CLI) is a thin wrapper around it.

Captured blocks:

* ``system_health`` -- verbatim ``rdhc --quick --json`` output (or null).
* ``rocm`` -- explicit reads of ``/opt/rocm/.info/version{,_dev}`` and
  ``/sys/module/amdgpu/version``.
* ``hip`` -- ``hipconfig`` toolchain outputs.
* ``hipblaslt`` -- commit + library hash + Tensile fingerprint + applied
  PR flags.
* ``rocblas`` -- mirror of ``hipblaslt`` for the rocBLAS library.
* ``composable_kernel`` -- two sub-blocks: ``system`` (header version +
  commit + ck_tile presence from the composablekernel-dev install) and
  ``pytorch_bundled`` (CK symbol count inside ``libtorch_hip.so``).
* ``tensile`` -- optional pip version + combined kernel-DB fingerprint
  across hipBLASLt and rocBLAS.
* ``triton``, ``fbgemm``, ``aiter`` -- Python-package version probes.
  ``fbgemm`` also surfaces the ``-DUSE_FBGEMM`` / ``-DUSE_FBGEMM_GENAI``
  build-time flags from ``torch.__config__.show()``.
* ``runtime_context`` -- container runtime + Python env detection.
* ``docker`` -- image + digest when in a container.
* ``env_vars`` -- canonical list of HSA / RCCL / FBGEMM / PyTorch vars.
* ``python_version``, ``pytorch_version``.

Fail-soft contract: ``collect_env()`` NEVER raises. Every probe that falls
back to ``None`` appends a human-readable reason to ``partial_reasons``;
the snapshot is then marked ``partial=True``. This keeps a triage matrix
running when the probe hits something missing (no rdhc, no sudo,
restricted dmesg) instead of aborting the whole run.

No GPU compute. No tensor allocations. Target wall time: <15 s with rdhc
present, <5 s without. Every capture function returns a fully-shaped dict
with ``None`` for missing values, so the schema is stable: keys never go
missing across environments.

SCHEMA_VERSION = "1.2"
# 1.1 -> 1.2 (this commit):
#   - Added `pytorch_build.flags` (build_settings, cxx_defines,
#     cxx_flags_raw, cuda_flags_raw, gpu_arch_list) -- structured raw
#     introspection from `torch.__config__.show()`.
#   - Added `pytorch_build.build_flags` (issue #170) -- stable 17-key
#     parsed bool/str/None subset projected from the structured flags
#     block; CAFFE2_USE_MIOPEN is treated as an alias for USE_MIOPEN.
#   - Added `pytorch_build.binary_introspection`
#     (libtorch_hip_symbol_counts, torch_lib_bundled,
#     cxx_flags_use_defines) -- pure-fact symbol counts and bundled-lib
#     presence from libtorch_hip.so via `nm | c++filt`.
#   - Extended `aiter` block: added `package_dist_name` (PyPI dist
#     identity, `amd_aiter` vs `aiter`) and `commit` (parsed from the
#     setuptools_scm `+g<sha>` local-version segment, matches the image
#     tag's `aiter-<sha>` label).
#   All additions are top-level-key-additive (every new field lives
#   under existing top-level dicts -- `pytorch_build`, `aiter` --
#   not as new top-level dataclass fields), so 1.1 readers running
#   `EnvSnapshot.from_dict(...)` against a 1.2 snapshot do NOT raise
#   and existing top-level access (`.pytorch_build`, `.aiter`) still
#   works. The new nested keys (`pytorch_build.flags`,
#   `pytorch_build.build_flags`, `pytorch_build.binary_introspection`,
#   `aiter.package_dist_name`, `aiter.commit`) are present on 1.2
#   snapshots and absent on 1.1 snapshots -- consumers indexing them
#   on a 1.1 snapshot get a KeyError, NOT None. Use `.get(key)` or
#   guard on `schema_version` if you read these.
#
# 1.0 -> 1.1:
#   - Renamed hipblaslt/rocblas/miopen.commit -> .rocm_release_tweak
#     (the field's value is the ROCm-release-shared identifier, not a
#     per-library upstream commit -- the old name misled consumers).
#   - Renamed hipblaslt/rocblas.tensile_yaml_revision -> .kernel_db_revision
#     (modern builds ship .dat not .yaml; matches miopen's naming).
#   - Removed USE_ROCM_CK_SDPA from env_vars (it's a build-time cmake
#     flag, not a runtime env var). Replaced with `pytorch_use_ck_sdpa`
#     and `pytorch_use_ck_gemm` booleans inside the composable_kernel
#     block, parsed from `torch.__config__.show()` (same pattern as the
#     existing `fbgemm.pytorch_use_fbgemm*` fields).
#   - Added top-level `host`, `miopen`, `rccl`, `gpu_arch`, `aotriton`,
#     `pytorch_build`, `composable_kernel`, `tensile`, `triton`,
#     `fbgemm`, `aiter`, `rocblas` blocks. All purely additive.
#   - Expanded CANONICAL_ENV_VARS across GPU scoping
#     (HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES / ROCR_VISIBLE_DEVICES /
#     HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION), launch (HIP_LAUNCH_BLOCKING), build
#     target (PYTORCH_ROCM_ARCH), MIOpen kernel-DB selection
#     (MIOPEN_SYSTEM_DB_PATH / MIOPEN_USER_DB_PATH /
#     MIOPEN_DEBUG_DISABLE_FIND_DB / MIOPEN_FIND_MODE), SDPA backend

#     TORCH_HIPBLASLT_TUNING_FILE / TORCH_HIPBLASLT_TUNING_OVERRIDE_FILE),
#     and NCCL/RCCL extras (NCCL_P2P_LEVEL / NCCL_IB_HCA /
#     NCCL_SOCKET_IFNAME / RCCL_MSCCL_ENABLE). Removed USE_ROCM_CK_SDPA

    1. **Settings pass** -- check every alias of the canonical name in

    """Wraps the env.json schema as a typed object.

    Attributes mirror the env.json keys 1-to-1; ``to_dict()`` / ``from_dict()``
    round-trip losslessly. The dataclass is ``frozen=True``, which prevents
    *attribute rebinding* on the snapshot itself (``snap.rocm = ...`` raises),
    but it does NOT deep-freeze the nested ``dict`` / ``list`` containers --
    callers can still mutate ``snap.rocm["version"] = ...`` or
    ``snap.partial_reasons.append(...)`` in place. Treat embedded snapshots
    as read-only; if you need to modify, deep-copy first via
    ``EnvSnapshot.from_dict(copy.deepcopy(snap.to_dict()))``.

    The two fail-soft fields make the snapshot honest about partial captures:

    * ``partial`` -- True if at least one probe fell back to None when it was
      expected to populate. False on a clean probe.
    * ``partial_reasons`` -- one human-readable string per fallback. The list
      is empty when ``partial`` is False. Each entry names the field plus a
      short cause (e.g. ``"system_health: rdhc not on PATH"``).

    "Documented absences" do NOT trigger partial:

    """Capture compile-time flags baked into the PyTorch wheel.

    Two introspection paths -- both work for wheel installs (no build
    artifacts on disk required):

    * ``torch.__config__.show()`` -- the host-side build config string.
      Yields a structured ``Build settings`` KEY=VALUE block plus the
      verbatim ``CXX_FLAGS`` / ``CUDA_FLAGS`` from cmake. We parse all
      ``-D<NAME>[=<value>]`` defines out of CXX_FLAGS into a dict so
      consumers can verify presence cheaply
      (``"USE_FLASH_ATTENTION" in flags["cxx_defines"]``).
    * ``torch.cuda.get_arch_list()`` -- the authoritative list of GPU
      architectures the wheel was compiled for (e.g. ``["gfx942",
      "gfx950"]``). Reads compiled-in metadata, no HIP context init.

    Captured fields (``None`` when torch is absent or __config__ raises):

    * ``build_settings`` -- dict of KEY=VALUE from the ``Build settings:``
      block (USE_CUDA, USE_ROCM, USE_NCCL, USE_MKLDNN, BUILD_TYPE,
      COMMIT_SHA, BLAS_INFO, ...). Values kept as captured strings
      ("ON"/"OFF" or non-boolean for BUILD_TYPE etc.); no coercion.
    * ``cxx_defines`` -- dict mapping each ``-D`` define name from
      ``CXX_FLAGS`` to its value (or ``None`` for value-less defines).
      The actionable subset of ``cxx_flags_raw``.
    * ``cxx_flags_raw`` / ``cuda_flags_raw`` -- the verbatim flag
      strings, preserved for grep over non-define args
      (``-fgpu-flush-denormals-to-zero``, ``-Wno-...``, ``-I`` paths).
    * ``gpu_arch_list`` -- ``torch.cuda.get_arch_list()`` output.

    Limitation: ``torch.__config__.show()`` reports only host-side C++
    flags. PyTorch's ATen-hip target applies many additional defines
    *only* when invoking HIPCC on .hip files (CK_TILE_FMHA_FWD_FAST_EXP2,
    AITER_ASM_DIR, HIPBLASLT_HAS_GETINDEXFROMALGO, HIPBLAS_V2,
    USE_FLASH_ATTENTION on some builds, the various warning
    suppressions, ...). Those are NOT recoverable from a wheel install
    -- they live in the build's ``compile_commands.json`` which is not
    shipped. For source/editable installs they could be read via the
    cmake-generated commands DB, but that path is out of scope for this
    probe (the env-probe runtime budget is ~5 s and parsing
    compile_commands.json alone costs more than that).
