"""``aorta env probe`` implementation (issue #147).

Library-first per the updated A1 spec: the primary deliverable is

* ``collect_env() -> EnvSnapshot``

which B1 (per-trial runner) and B2 (matrix runner) call **in-process** so
every trial / matrix run records its environment without shelling out.
``aorta env probe`` (CLI) is a thin wrapper around it.

Captured blocks:

* ``system_health`` -- verbatim ``rdhc --quick --json`` output (or null).
* ``rocm`` -- explicit reads of ``/opt/rocm/.info/version{,_dev}`` and
  ``/sys/module/amdgpu/version``.
* ``hip`` -- ``hipconfig`` toolchain outputs.
* ``hipblaslt`` -- commit + library hash + Tensile fingerprint + applied
  PR flags.
* ``rocblas`` -- mirror of ``hipblaslt`` for the rocBLAS library.
* ``composable_kernel`` -- two sub-blocks: ``system`` (header version +
  commit + ck_tile presence from the composablekernel-dev install) and
  ``pytorch_bundled`` (CK symbol count inside ``libtorch_hip.so``).
* ``tensile`` -- optional pip version + combined kernel-DB fingerprint
  across hipBLASLt and rocBLAS.
* ``triton``, ``fbgemm``, ``aiter`` -- Python-package version probes.
  ``fbgemm`` also surfaces the ``-DUSE_FBGEMM`` / ``-DUSE_FBGEMM_GENAI``
  build-time flags from ``torch.__config__.show()``.
* ``runtime_context`` -- container runtime + Python env detection.
* ``docker`` -- image + digest when in a container.
* ``env_vars`` -- canonical list of HSA / RCCL / FBGEMM / PyTorch vars.
* ``python_version``, ``pytorch_version``.

Fail-soft contract: ``collect_env()`` NEVER raises. Every probe that falls
back to ``None`` appends a human-readable reason to ``partial_reasons``;
the snapshot is then marked ``partial=True``. This keeps a triage matrix
running when the probe hits something missing (no rdhc, no sudo,
restricted dmesg) instead of aborting the whole run.

No GPU compute. No tensor allocations. Target wall time: <15 s with rdhc
present, <5 s without. Every capture function returns a fully-shaped dict
with ``None`` for missing values, so the schema is stable: keys never go
missing across environments.

SCHEMA_VERSION = "1.8"
# 1.7 -> 1.8 (Buck-target torch recovery + package commits):
#   - ``triton`` and ``fbgemm`` blocks each gained a ``commit`` key
#     (nested, additive). Best-effort git SHA parsed from a
#     setuptools_scm ``+g<sha>`` local-version segment, a ROCm/fb fork
#     ``.git<sha>`` segment, or a ``git_version`` / ``__commit__`` module
#     attribute. ``None`` when no commit is recoverable (e.g. fb wheels
#     versioned ``3.5.0+fb`` carry no SHA; fbgemm not separately
#     installed). Mirrors the existing ``aiter.commit`` field. 1.7
#     readers indexing ``triton["commit"]`` / ``fbgemm["commit"]`` on a
#     pre-1.8 snapshot get a KeyError -- guard with ``.get(...)``.
#   - No new top-level keys and no dataclass-field changes, so
#     ``EnvSnapshot.from_dict`` on a <=1.7 snapshot still round-trips.
#   - Behavioural (not schema-shape) change folded into this bump: the
#     ``libtorch_hip.so``-dependent probes (composable_kernel
#     pytorch_bundled symbol_count, aotriton bundled_*,
#     pytorch_build.binary_introspection symbol counts / torch_lib_bundled)
#     now locate torch's native lib dir via ``/proc/self/maps`` when
#     ``<torch>/lib`` is absent. This populates those previously-null
#     fields for Buck/monorepo torch targets (e.g. fbcode //caffe2:torch)
#     whose C++ runtime is dlopen'd from a build-artifact dir rather than
#     laid out under the Python package. No field shapes change.
#
# 1.6 -> 1.7 (issue #202, RCCL net-plugin + multi-vendor NIC stack):
#   - New top-level ``nics`` block keyed by vendor (``ainic``,
#     ``broadcom``, ``cx7``). Each entry has a Tier-0 ``present`` gate
#     (from ``lspci -d <vendor>:<device>``), Tier-1 sudo-free fields
#     (``driver_version``, ``firmware``, ``rdma_devices``, ``links``),
#     and -- AINIC only -- Tier-2 ``nicctl`` fields (``nicctl_version``,
#     ``card``, ``profile``, ``dcqcn``) gathered via ``sudo -n``.
#     A vendor that is absent from ``lspci`` is a DOCUMENTED ABSENCE
#     (``present: false``, no ``partial``); only an expected-but-failed
#     capture appends a reason. Additive: ``EnvSnapshot.nics`` uses
#     ``field(default_factory=dict)`` so ``from_dict`` on a <=1.6
#     snapshot still round-trips.
#   - The ``rccl`` block gained ``net_plugin_mode`` / ``plugin_path`` /
#     ``plugin_lib_hash`` / ``anp_lib_hash`` / ``net_lib_hash`` (nested
#     keys; no separate bump, folded into this one).
#
# 1.5 -> 1.6 (PR #187 review):
#   - Each ``library_introspection`` entry now carries TWO Buck-label
#     fields instead of one: ``target`` (canonical Buck label,
#     suitable for re-querying buck2; was previously the raw cquery
#     output) and ``configured_target`` (the raw cquery output
#     including the per-run configuration suffix
#     ``(prelude//platforms:default#<hash>)``). The motivation is
#     that the configuration hash changes between buck2 daemon
#     restarts even for the same source tree; storing only the
#     suffixed form (as A1.2b's first draft did, schema 1.4) made
#     env.json diffs unstable across repeat probes. ``target`` is
#     now the stable identifier; ``configured_target`` is kept for
#     forensics when reconciling two probes that diverged on the
#     same source. Backwards-compat: 1.5 readers loading a 1.6
#     snapshot see ``configured_target`` as an unknown nested key
#     and silently ignore it (entries are plain dicts, not dataclasses);
#     1.6 readers loading a 1.5 snapshot get entries without
#     ``configured_target`` and must guard with ``.get(...)`` if
#     they want it.
#
# 1.4 -> 1.5 (PR #177 / issue #176):
#   This entry collapses what was originally two separate version
#   bumps on the PR #177 branch (1.2 -> 1.3 source-introspection plus
#   1.3 -> 1.4 legacy-FindHIP fallback) because main shipped its own
#   1.3 and 1.4 in parallel (PR #164 / PR #165). All five additive
#   surfaces below are net-new on top of main's 1.4.
#   - Added `pytorch_build.cmake_cache`: parsed cmake cache entries
#     from `<source>/build/CMakeCache.txt` for source / editable
#     installs, filtered by an allowlist of name prefixes (USE_,
#     CK_, AITER_, FLASH_, HIPBLAS, ...). Wheel installs render
#     `entries: null` with no partial reason -- absence is the
#     documented common case.
#   - Added `pytorch_build.ninja_hipcc`: per-target HIPCC defines +
#     codegen flags + offload archs. Two parser strategies in one
#     block, discriminated by `_parser`:
#       * `"ninja_defines"` -- streamed parse of
#         `<source>/build/build.ninja` for the modern
#         `enable_language(HIP)` build shape. Identifies targets via
#         the `-D<target>_EXPORTS` token cmake appends per shared-lib
#         target.
#       * `"legacy_findhip_per_source"` -- fallback walk of
#         `<source>/build/**/<target>.dir/**/*.hip.o.cmake` driver
#         scripts when the ninja-only scan returns `targets: {}`
#         (common on ROCm/PyTorch Jenkins images that still use the
#         legacy `FindHIP.cmake` flow). Parses
#         `set(HIP_HIPCC_FLAGS …)` / `set(HIP_CLANG_FLAGS …)` cmake-
#         list values; `_legacy_scripts_scanned` reports the read
#         count.
#     Both parsers report the same per-target shape (`defines`,
#     `use_defines_present`, `codegen_flags_present`,
#     `offload_archs`). Targets reported: `torch_hip`, `torch_cpu`,
#     `c10_hip`, `ck_sdpa` (CK-backed SDPA backend; owns
#     USE_ROCM_CK_SDPA, CK_TILE_FMHA_*, FLASHATTENTION_DISABLE_* --
#     statically linked into libtorch_hip.so so its flags don't
#     appear in the wheel's host-side CXX_FLAGS), `mslk` (Multi-
#     Stream Layer Kernels). Wheel installs render `targets: null`.
#   - Added `aiter.hsa_tree`: per-arch fingerprint of aiter's pre-
#     compiled HSA `.co` kernel binaries (file_count, co_count,
#     deterministic combined_sha256 over sorted (relpath, sha256)
#     pairs). Searches importlib.util.find_spec("aiter_meta"), the
#     sibling aiter_meta dir, and $AORTA_PYTORCH_SRC/third_party/
#     aiter/hsa. Returns null when no tree is locatable -- silent
#     absence (most installs lack it).
#   - Added new top-level `pytorch_sdpa` block: runtime SDPA backend
#     state via torch.backends.cuda.{flash, mem_efficient, math,
#     cudnn}_sdp_enabled(). Per-backend null when the getter is
#     missing on older torch (distinguishable from True/False). Pre-
#     1.5 readers loading a 1.5 snapshot via EnvSnapshot.from_dict()
#     see this as an unknown top-level key and silently skip it
#     (from_dict's known-key filter rejects unknown keys). 1.5
#     readers loading a pre-1.5 snapshot get the dataclass-default
#     backends_enabled dict (all None) -- no TypeError.
#   Backwards-compat: every new nested key lives under existing top-
#   level dicts (or, for pytorch_sdpa, behind a dataclass default),
#   so 1.4 readers loading a 1.5 snapshot do NOT raise. Consumers
#   indexing the new nested keys (cmake_cache, ninja_hipcc, hsa_tree,
#   _parser, _legacy_scripts_scanned) directly on a 1.4 snapshot get
#   KeyError, not None -- use `.get(key)` or guard on schema_version.
#
# 1.3 -> 1.4 (issue #163 / A1.2b):
#   - Added top-level `library_introspection` (list[dict], default `[]`)
#     and `library_introspection_alternates` (list[dict], default `[]`).
#     Both always present. Populated only when collect_env() is called
#     with `buck_target=...` AND buck2 is functional; in that mode each
#     transitive dep label matched against
#     buck_introspect.KNOWN_LIBRARY_PATTERNS yields an entry of the
#     form ``{"name", "source": "buck", "revision", "target"}``
#     (schema 1.6 also adds ``"configured_target"``; see the 1.5 ->
#     1.6 history block above). When
#     a library matched via Buck is also captured by A1's existing
#     per-library blocks (hipblaslt, rocblas, ...), the A1-side
#     identifiers are synthesised into a parallel entry placed in
#     `library_introspection_alternates`. Outside buck mode both lists
#     are empty; A1's existing per-library top-level blocks remain
#     unchanged and authoritative.
#
# 1.2 -> 1.3 (issue #163 / A1.2a):
#   - Added top-level `build_system` block (always present). Populated
#     by aorta.instrumentation.build_system.detect_build_system(); the
#     value is `{"kind": "buck2", "buck2_version": str, "repo_root":
#     str, "revision": str | None}` when buck2 is on PATH AND both
#     `buck2 --version` and `buck2 root` succeed (i.e. we are
#     demonstrably inside a Buck checkout), or `{"kind": "none"}` in
#     every other case -- including the common "buck2 is installed
#     but cwd is not inside a Buck repo" branch where `buck2 root`
#     exits non-zero. The buck2 shape's `buck2_version` and
#     `repo_root` are guaranteed populated; only `revision` may be
#     None. Existing system-package / pkg-config / Docker-digest
#     blocks are unchanged.
#   - `EnvSnapshot.from_dict()` defaults a missing `build_system` key
#     to `{"kind": "none"}`, so a 1.3 reader can still load a 1.1 /
#     1.2 env.json. Mirrors the existing `partial_reasons` tolerance.
#
# 1.1 -> 1.2:
#   - Added `pytorch_build.flags` (build_settings, cxx_defines,
#     cxx_flags_raw, cuda_flags_raw, gpu_arch_list) -- structured raw
#     introspection from `torch.__config__.show()`.
#   - Added `pytorch_build.build_flags` (issue #170) -- stable 17-key
#     parsed bool/str/None subset projected from the structured flags
#     block; CAFFE2_USE_MIOPEN is treated as an alias for USE_MIOPEN.
#   - Added `pytorch_build.binary_introspection`
#     (libtorch_hip_symbol_counts, torch_lib_bundled,
#     cxx_flags_use_defines) -- pure-fact symbol counts and bundled-lib
#     presence from libtorch_hip.so via `nm | c++filt`.
#   - Extended `aiter` block: added `package_dist_name` (PyPI dist
#     identity, `amd_aiter` vs `aiter`) and `commit` (parsed from the
#     setuptools_scm `+g<sha>` local-version segment, matches the image
#     tag's `aiter-<sha>` label).
#   All additions are top-level-key-additive (every new field lives
#   under existing top-level dicts -- `pytorch_build`, `aiter` --
#   not as new top-level dataclass fields), so 1.1 readers running
#   `EnvSnapshot.from_dict(...)` against a 1.2 snapshot do NOT raise
#   and existing top-level access (`.pytorch_build`, `.aiter`) still
#   works. The new nested keys (`pytorch_build.flags`,
#   `pytorch_build.build_flags`, `pytorch_build.binary_introspection`,
#   `aiter.package_dist_name`, `aiter.commit`) are present on 1.2
#   snapshots and absent on 1.1 snapshots -- consumers indexing them
#   on a 1.1 snapshot get a KeyError, NOT None. Use `.get(key)` or
#   guard on `schema_version` if you read these.
#
# 1.0 -> 1.1:
#   - Renamed hipblaslt/rocblas/miopen.commit -> .rocm_release_tweak
#     (the field's value is the ROCm-release-shared identifier, not a
#     per-library upstream commit -- the old name misled consumers).
#   - Renamed hipblaslt/rocblas.tensile_yaml_revision -> .kernel_db_revision
#     (modern builds ship .dat not .yaml; matches miopen's naming).
#   - Removed USE_ROCM_CK_SDPA from env_vars (it's a build-time cmake
#     flag, not a runtime env var). Replaced with `pytorch_use_ck_sdpa`
#     and `pytorch_use_ck_gemm` booleans inside the composable_kernel
#     block, parsed from `torch.__config__.show()` (same pattern as the
#     existing `fbgemm.pytorch_use_fbgemm*` fields).
#   - Added top-level `host`, `miopen`, `rccl`, `gpu_arch`, `aotriton`,
#     `pytorch_build`, `composable_kernel`, `tensile`, `triton`,
#     `fbgemm`, `aiter`, `rocblas` blocks. All purely additive.
#   - Expanded CANONICAL_ENV_VARS across GPU scoping
#     (HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES / ROCR_VISIBLE_DEVICES /
#     HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION), launch (HIP_LAUNCH_BLOCKING), build
#     target (PYTORCH_ROCM_ARCH), MIOpen kernel-DB selection
#     (MIOPEN_SYSTEM_DB_PATH / MIOPEN_USER_DB_PATH /
#     MIOPEN_DEBUG_DISABLE_FIND_DB / MIOPEN_FIND_MODE), SDPA backend
#     (TORCH_ROCM_FA_PREFER_CK / TORCH_ROCM_AOTRITON_ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL),
#     hipBLASLt autotune (TORCH_BLAS_PREFER_HIPBLASLT /
#     TORCH_HIPBLASLT_TUNING_FILE / TORCH_HIPBLASLT_TUNING_OVERRIDE_FILE),
#     and NCCL/RCCL extras (NCCL_P2P_LEVEL / NCCL_IB_HCA /
#     NCCL_SOCKET_IFNAME / RCCL_MSCCL_ENABLE). Removed USE_ROCM_CK_SDPA
#     (build-time cmake flag, see above). See CANONICAL_ENV_VARS for
#     the full set.
#   - host.glibc_version no longer carries the redundant "glibc "
#     prefix; the value is the bare version string (e.g. "2.35").

# RDHC subprocess budget. The issue caps at 30 s; we keep that to stay
# inside the 30 s worst-case env probe budget.
RDHC_TIMEOUT_SEC = 30.0

# Pointer appended to install-related rdhc partial_reasons so operators

    CXX_FLAGS define injection" precedence even when aliases are in
    play:

    1. **Settings pass** -- check every alias of the canonical name in
       ``Build settings:`` KEY=VALUE pairs first. A hit anywhere in the

    2. **Defines pass** -- only if the settings pass found nothing,
       check every alias in ``CXX_FLAGS`` ``-D<NAME>[=<value>]``
       defines. A bare ``-D<NAME>`` (no value) renders as ``True``
       (presence-as-define is the cmake convention for "feature

    Attributes mirror the env.json keys 1-to-1; ``to_dict()`` / ``from_dict()``
    round-trip losslessly. The dataclass is ``frozen=True``, which prevents
    *attribute rebinding* on the snapshot itself (``snap.rocm = ...`` raises),
    but it does NOT deep-freeze the nested ``dict`` / ``list`` containers --
    callers can still mutate ``snap.rocm["version"] = ...`` or
    ``snap.partial_reasons.append(...)`` in place. Treat embedded snapshots
    as read-only; if you need to modify, deep-copy first via
    ``EnvSnapshot.from_dict(copy.deepcopy(snap.to_dict()))``.

    The two fail-soft fields make the snapshot honest about partial captures:

    * ``partial`` -- True if at least one probe fell back to None when it was
      expected to populate. False on a clean probe.
    * ``partial_reasons`` -- one human-readable string per fallback. The list
      is empty when ``partial`` is False. Each entry names the field plus a
      short cause (e.g. ``"system_health: rdhc not on PATH"``).

    "Documented absences" do NOT trigger partial:

    * ``docker == None`` on baremetal (no container, nothing to record)
    * ``env_vars[X] == None`` for an unset env var (the documented contract)
    * ``runtime_context.venv_path == None`` outside a venv

    """Capture the current process environment as an :class:`EnvSnapshot`.

    NEVER raises. The promise is enforced two ways:

    * Every probe is individually fail-soft (returns None or a shaped
      dict; appends a human-readable reason to a shared list on fallback).
    * The orchestrator body is wrapped in a top-level ``try / except
      Exception``. If anything genuinely unexpected raises (a stdlib call
      misbehaves, a probe is buggy, etc.), the disaster-recovery helper
      :func:`_disaster_snapshot` constructs a minimally-shaped
      :class:`EnvSnapshot` with ``partial=True`` and the original
      exception captured in ``partial_reasons``. Callers (B1 dispatcher,
      B2 matrix runner, CLI) always get back a valid object.

    No GPU compute. No tensor allocations. The optional ``import torch``
    for the version probe does NOT initialise CUDA / HIP context.

    Buck mode (``buck_target=...``) opts into the A1.2b path: the
    function additionally runs ``buck2 cquery 'deps(<target>)' --json``,
    matches transitive deps against
    ``buck_introspect.KNOWN_LIBRARY_PATTERNS``, and populates
    ``library_introspection`` (plus ``library_introspection_alternates``
    when an A1 per-library block also captured the same name). Each
    ``library_introspection`` entry carries both a canonical
    ``target`` (stripped Buck label, stable across daemon restarts)
    and a ``configured_target`` (raw cquery output including the
    per-run configuration suffix) per schema 1.6. Outside buck mode
    both lists stay empty and the existing per-library top-level
    blocks remain authoritative. ``buck_timeout`` caps the cquery

    ``aiter``. The image tag often encodes the aiter commit (e.g.

    1. ``aiter.__version__`` (most packages set this).
    2. ``aiter._version.__version__`` (where ``setuptools_scm`` writes

    Records the dist name we matched and, when the version carries a

    Note: upstream PyTorch also vendors AITER as a third_party/

    """Capture compile-time flags baked into the PyTorch wheel.

    Two introspection paths -- both work for wheel installs (no build
    artifacts on disk required):

    * ``torch.__config__.show()`` -- the host-side build config string.
      Yields a structured ``Build settings`` KEY=VALUE block plus the
      verbatim ``CXX_FLAGS`` / ``CUDA_FLAGS`` from cmake. We parse all
      ``-D<NAME>[=<value>]`` defines out of CXX_FLAGS into a dict so
      consumers can verify presence cheaply
      (``"USE_FLASH_ATTENTION" in flags["cxx_defines"]``).
    * ``torch.cuda.get_arch_list()`` -- the authoritative list of GPU
      architectures the wheel was compiled for (e.g. ``["gfx942",
      "gfx950"]``). Reads compiled-in metadata, no HIP context init.

    Captured fields (``None`` when torch is absent or __config__ raises):

    * ``build_settings`` -- dict of KEY=VALUE from the ``Build settings:``
      block (USE_CUDA, USE_ROCM, USE_NCCL, USE_MKLDNN, BUILD_TYPE,
      COMMIT_SHA, BLAS_INFO, ...). Values kept as captured strings
      ("ON"/"OFF" or non-boolean for BUILD_TYPE etc.); no coercion.
    * ``cxx_defines`` -- dict mapping each ``-D`` define name from
      ``CXX_FLAGS`` to its value (or ``None`` for value-less defines).
      The actionable subset of ``cxx_flags_raw``.
    * ``cxx_flags_raw`` / ``cuda_flags_raw`` -- the verbatim flag
      strings, preserved for grep over non-define args
      (``-fgpu-flush-denormals-to-zero``, ``-Wno-...``, ``-I`` paths).
    * ``gpu_arch_list`` -- ``torch.cuda.get_arch_list()`` output.

    Limitation: ``torch.__config__.show()`` reports only host-side C++
    flags. PyTorch's ATen-hip target applies many additional defines
    *only* when invoking HIPCC on .hip files (CK_TILE_FMHA_FWD_FAST_EXP2,
    AITER_ASM_DIR, HIPBLASLT_HAS_GETINDEXFROMALGO, HIPBLAS_V2,
    USE_FLASH_ATTENTION on some builds, the various warning
    suppressions, ...). Those are NOT recoverable from a wheel install
    -- they live in the build's ``compile_commands.json`` which is not
    shipped. For source/editable installs they could be read via the
    cmake-generated commands DB, but that path is out of scope for this
    probe (the env-probe runtime budget is ~5 s and parsing
    compile_commands.json alone costs more than that).

    """Parse ``<source>/build/build.ninja`` for per-target HIPCC defines.

    The authoritative source for what HIPCC actually compiled the .hip
    files with. ``torch.__config__.show()`` only exposes the host-side
    ``CXX_FLAGS``; the per-target HIPCC flags (``USE_ROCM_CK_SDPA``,
    ``DISABLE_AOTRITON``, ``CK_TILE_FMHA_FWD_FAST_EXP2``,
    ``-fgpu-flush-denormals-to-zero``, ...) live ONLY in build.ninja's
    per-rule ``DEFINES = ...`` and ``FLAGS = ...`` blocks.

    cmake's ninja generator emits the same DEFINES line for every
    source file in a target, so build.ninja typically has thousands of
    identical DEFINES lines collapsing to ~50 unique blocks. Each
    block is identified by the ``-D<target>_EXPORTS`` token cmake
    appends per shared-lib target (``torch_hip_EXPORTS``,
    ``c10_hip_EXPORTS``, ...).

    Captured per target in :data:`_NINJA_HIPCC_TARGETS_OF_INTEREST`:

    * ``defines`` -- sorted dict of every ``-D`` define passed to that
      target (name -> value or ``None``).
    * ``use_defines_present`` -- yes/no map for the customer-relevant
      flags in :data:`_NINJA_HIPCC_FLAGS_OF_INTEREST`. Fast diff key.
    * ``codegen_flags_present`` -- yes/no map for the FP / denormal
      codegen flags in :data:`_NINJA_HIPCC_CODEGEN_FLAGS_OF_INTEREST`.
    * ``offload_archs`` -- sorted list of ``--offload-arch=`` values
      observed in the target's FLAGS line.

    Returns ``targets: None`` for wheel installs (build.ninja absent).
    When build.ninja exists but no targets-of-interest matched in the
    ninja-only scan, the function falls back to
    :func:`_capture_pytorch_legacy_findhip`, which walks per-source
    ``*.hip.o.cmake`` driver scripts emitted by the legacy
    ``FindHIP.cmake`` build path. If that fallback finds nothing
    either, returns ``_source_file`` populated and ``targets: {}`` --
    distinguishable from the wheel/no-file case so consumers know we
    DID scan.

    Two additive keys discriminate which parser produced the result:

    * ``_parser`` -- ``"ninja_defines"`` (modern ``enable_language(HIP)``
      shape) or ``"legacy_findhip_per_source"`` (the per-source cmake
      script fallback) or ``None`` (no parse attempted / both failed).
    * ``_legacy_scripts_scanned`` -- int count of ``*.hip.o.cmake``
      files read when the fallback fired; ``None`` otherwise.

    Streams the file line-by-line: build.ninja can be 350+ MB on a
    fully-built tree so we must not slurp. Long Ninja variable
    assignments use ``$\\n`` continuation; the inner generator folds
    those before the regex pass so a DEFINES that wraps onto follow-on
    lines isn't silently truncated (the per-target ``_EXPORTS`` marker
    or any -D define can land anywhere in the wrapped value).

#
# ``driver`` is the authoritative key for binding RDMA devices and links
# to a vendor. We do NOT match on RDMA/netdev device-NAME prefixes: device
# names (ionic_0 vs rdma3, benic7p1 vs tw-eth0) are an admin/kernel choice
# and vary between hosts -- prefix matching silently dropped all 8 ACTIVE
# RoCE links on an AINIC host whose devices were named rdma0..rdma7
# (reported on PR #208). Instead, each ibv/rdma device is resolved to its
# bound kernel driver via the sysfs ``device/driver`` symlink, which is
# the same name regardless of how the device was named.
#
# Confirmed against a live node (8x BCM57608 + 2x ConnectX-7): the
# /sys/module/<drv>/version file does NOT exist for mlx5_core or bnxt_en
# on a modern in-tree-module kernel, so driver_version falls back to the
