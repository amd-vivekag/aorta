@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Environment:
    """A baseline process / container recipe for a workload run.

    `docker`, `venv`, `buck_target`, and `mirage_profile` are independent ways
    of describing the baseline; any combination (or none) may be set — built-in
    `local` has none (current process). `emulator` is an optional hint that
    pairs with `mirage_profile` to name the GPU-emulation backend (see below). No `rocm` field: ROCm version is
    implicit in the docker image digest, the host the venv runs on, or the
    captured `revision` of the Buck checkout; capture it from `aorta env probe`
    at runtime.

    `buck_target` is a Buck2 target label (e.g. `"//workloads/recom_repro:recom_repro"`).
    Interpreted by Buck-aware workload wrappers analogous to how `docker` is
    interpreted by docker-aware wrappers: the platform threads the field; the
    wrapper decides to shell out to `buck2 run <label>`. The platform itself
    does not invoke Buck (mirrors the no-docker-launching-in-platform policy:
    the platform threads tier hints, wrappers decide how to launch).

    `mirage_profile` / `emulator` describe a GPU-emulated baseline driven by the
    mirage control plane + rocjitsu software emulator (run AORTA workloads with
    no physical GPU). `mirage_profile` is the name of a mirage profile (which
    itself encodes the emulator backend, topology, and exec mode);
    `emulator` is an optional convenience hint naming the backend
    (`"rocjitsu"` / `"hotswap"` / `"noop"`) for callers that don't pin a full
    profile. Same threading contract as the fields above: the platform threads
    them into `_aorta_environment`; an emulation-aware launch backend
    (`aorta.emulation.mirage_launch`) decides how to launch (e.g. `mirage run
    --profile <p> -- <argv>`, or an `LD_PRELOAD` env overlay). The platform
    itself launches nothing.
