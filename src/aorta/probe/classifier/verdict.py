"""Verdict precedence resolver for ``aorta probe`` Phase 2 (issue #188).

Combines the per-tier detector outputs into the final
``result.json`` shape. The three-way verdict (issue #230) is one of
``pass`` / ``fail`` / ``error``:

(a) ``fail`` -- the event of interest manifested. Any Tier 1–4
    detector fires (other than the *error* detectors below) OR any
    ``custom_patterns[*]`` with ``on_match: fail`` fires.

(b) ``error`` -- the trial broke for an infrastructure reason and
    produced *no valid observation* of the thing under test: the
    command never launched (``tier1:exec_failed``) or it ran to the
    deadline without the hang monitor recognising a hang
    (``tier1:timeout`` with no co-firing ``tier2:hang``). Error
    detectors are listed in :data:`ERROR_DETECTOR_IDS`. ``error``
    is excluded from the matrix event-rate denominator so an infra
    flake doesn't inflate (or deflate) the reproduction rate.

(c) ``pass`` -- nothing fired.

Precedence is **fail > error > pass**: if any genuine failure
detector fired, the trial failed *even if* an error detector also
fired (a timeout that the monitor recognised as a hang fires both
``tier1:timeout`` and ``tier2:hang`` -> the hang wins -> ``fail``).
Only when error detectors fired and no failure detector did does
the verdict become ``error``.

``result.json`` carries two ordered lists: ``failure_detectors_fired``
(the fail signals) and ``error_detectors_fired`` (the error signals),
each in a fixed encounter order: Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3, Tier 4,
then Tier 5 (``custom_patterns`` failures). The order is set
explicitly by :func:`resolve` as a fixed tier sequence (not by the
:class:`VerdictInputs` field order), independent of when each tier
physically fires relative to the workload exit. The in-flight Tier 2
hang monitor contributes its detector IDs to ``inputs.tier2`` before
:func:`resolve` is called, so even though the predicate fires
mid-run, the IDs always land between Tier 1 and Tier 3 in the
serialised list.

``custom_patterns[*]`` with ``required_for_pass: true`` AND none of
them fired → add ``meta:missing_pass_signal`` to
``failure_detectors_fired`` AND ``verdict = "fail"``.

``on_match: warn`` populates ``warn_detectors_fired`` only.
``on_match: info`` populates ``capture`` only.

The resolver consumes :class:`VerdictInputs` (a plain bundle of
per-tier outputs) and returns :class:`Verdict`. Both are
dataclasses so the call site stays declarative and unit tests can
build inputs in one line.
