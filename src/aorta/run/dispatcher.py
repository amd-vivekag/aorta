"""Run dispatcher - orchestrates workload execution across trials.

The dispatcher is the core of `aorta run`. It:
1. Discovers and instantiates workloads
2. Validates launch mode before execution
3. Applies environment and mitigation configuration
4. Runs trials and collects results
5. Persists results as JSON (rank 0 only for distributed)

    """Configuration for a run_trials() invocation.

    The dataclass is ``frozen=True`` to prevent attribute reassignment,
    but ``extra_env`` and ``config_overrides`` are dicts -- ``frozen``
    does not stop callers from mutating those nested structures.
    ``__post_init__`` therefore stores deep copies, so an in-flight
    request can never be mutated out from under the dispatcher.  This
    mirrors the same defensive pattern used by :class:`TrialResult`.

    Attributes:
        workload: Name of the workload to run (from entry-point group).
        trials: Number of trials to execute.
        environment: Environment name (default: local).
        mitigations: Tuple of mitigation names to apply.
        extra_env: Additional environment variables (override mitigations).
        steps: Number of steps per trial (workload-specific).
        config_overrides: Additional workload configuration.
        results_dir: Directory to write per-trial JSON files.
        collect: Collector recipe names (MVP: validated but no-op).
        sidecar_files: JSON sidecar files describing ad-hoc mitigations
            and/or environments (B3.1).  Forwarded to
            ``aorta.registry.get_mitigation`` /
            ``aorta.registry.get_environment`` so that names declared in
            the sidecar resolve in the same call as built-ins and
            entry-point plugins.
        dataset_index: Cell coordinate on the dataset / environment axis,
            used in ``trial_id`` and the per-trial JSON filename.
            ``aorta run`` is one cell, so the default ``0`` is correct
            for direct CLI use; ``aorta triage`` (B2) calls
            ``run_trials`` once per cell and varies this index across
            its environment axis so cells in the matrix don't collide
            on disk.
        mitigation_index: Cell coordinate on the mitigation axis (same
            rationale as ``dataset_index``).  ``aorta triage`` varies
            this across its mitigation axis; ``aorta run`` always emits
            ``m0``.
