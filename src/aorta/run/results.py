@dataclass(frozen=True)
class TrialResult:
    """Per-trial result wrapper around WorkloadResult.

    Schema version 0.1 (unstable until external consumers pin it).

    The dataclass is ``frozen=True`` to prevent attribute reassignment,
    but ``execution_env`` / ``config`` / ``env`` / ``result`` are dicts
    -- ``frozen`` does not stop callers from mutating those nested
    structures.  ``__post_init__`` and ``from_dict`` therefore store
    deep copies, so a ``TrialResult`` is effectively immutable from
    construction time and an in-memory result can never silently drift
    from its persisted JSON form.

    Attributes:
        schema_version: Version of the result schema (for future migration).
        trial_id: Unique identifier for this trial.  Encodes the cell
            coordinates so artifacts from different cells in a triage
            matrix don't collide: ``<workload>_d<dataset_index>_m<mitigation_index>_t<trial_index>``
            (e.g. ``"fsdp_d0_m0_t0"``).  ``aorta run`` is one cell so
            ``d`` and ``m`` are always ``0``; ``aorta triage`` (B2)
            varies them across the matrix.
        workload: Name of the workload that was executed.
        execution_env: Environment descriptor as dict.  Mirrors the
            :class:`aorta.registry.Environment` shape:
            ``{"name": str, "docker": str | None, "venv": str | None,
            "source_package": str}``.  ROCm version, runtime kind, and
            container image digest are NOT part of this block -- they
            live inside ``env`` (A1's ``EnvSnapshot``: ``rocm``,
            ``runtime_context.type``, ``docker.digest``) so that the
            descriptor stays a static recipe and the snapshot stays a
            runtime observation.
        mitigations_applied: Tuple of mitigation names that were applied.
        config: Configuration dict passed to the workload.
        env: Environment snapshot as dict (from A1's
            ``collect_env`` -- includes ``rocm``, ``hip``,
            ``runtime_context``, ``docker``, ``env_vars``,
            ``partial`` / ``partial_reasons``, etc.).
        result: WorkloadResult serialized to dict.
        wall_clock_sec: Total wall clock time for the trial.
        exit_status: Outcome of the trial execution.  Values:

            * ``"ok"`` -- workload ran and reported ``passed=True``.
            * ``"workload_failed"`` -- workload ran and reported
              ``passed=False`` from ``run()`` (e.g. NaN detected,
              assertion fired mid-loop).
            * ``"workload_setup_failed"`` -- ``workload.setup()`` raised
              before the workload's main work could begin (e.g. missing
              dependency at import time, broken env probe). Distinct
              from ``infrastructure_failed`` so a setup-time crash
              can't masquerade as a 100 % failure rate of the
              measurement under test -- a row of all-setup-failures
              means the workload never got off the ground, not that
              the bug reproduces every trial.
            * ``"infrastructure_failed"`` -- the dispatcher caught an
              exception that wasn't attributable to ``setup()``: the
              workload class itself failed to construct
              (``workload_cls(config)`` raised), or ``run()`` raised
              after ``setup()`` returned cleanly.

            ``"timeout"`` is deliberately NOT in the literal: B1 ships
            no ``--timeout`` flag and no watchdog, so no code path can
            produce it.  Re-add the value in the same commit that adds
            a producer (e.g. when a ``--timeout`` watchdog lands).

    This is the single shared predicate (issue #230) used by the matrix
    aggregator (pass / fail / error counts) and the ``stop_after`` event
    counter (:mod:`aorta.run.dispatcher`) so the two can never disagree
    about whether a trial reproduced the bug, failed for an infra reason,
    or passed.

    stand-ins in tests). Resolution order:

    1. **Probe trials** carry the classifier's three-way verdict in
       ``result["metrics"]["verdict"]``; it is authoritative. (A probe
       ``error`` trial reports ``passed=False`` and therefore
       ``exit_status == "workload_failed"``, so the metric is the only
       place the error/fail distinction survives.)
    2. **Other trials** (triage workloads with no probe verdict) derive
       it from ``exit_status``: an ``infrastructure_failed`` /
       ``workload_setup_failed`` trial never validly ran the measurement
       -> ``error``; any other non-``ok`` status, or a ``WorkloadResult``
       reporting ``passed is False`` -> ``fail``; otherwise ``pass``.
