"""Speed-confound detection for the triage matrix.

A mitigation that eliminates a numeric failure is only "real" if it does so
without paying a measurable iteration-time cost. The Confound column in
matrix.md captures exactly that distinction:

* ``(baseline)`` -- the cell step-time ratios are computed against.
* ``-`` (em-dash) -- mitigation appears to work without a speed cost. Trust
  the cell.
* ``speed (+N%)`` -- mitigation may be suppressing failure via slower
  iteration rather than a real fix. Verify with a profiler before drawing
  causal conclusions.
* ``no effect`` -- neither the failure rate nor the iteration time moved.
  The mitigation likely doesn't apply to this workload.
* ``n/a`` -- the baseline cell errored or produced no usable timing data,
  so no step-time ratio could be computed for *any* non-baseline cell.
  Distinct from ``-`` (which advertises a trustworthy cell): re-using the
  neutral tag here would mislead readers of matrix.md into trusting cells
  that were never compared against anything.
* ``error`` -- the whole cell failed. Row preserved so the matrix is
  complete; classification is skipped.

See §"Confound rules" of issue #151 for the exact semantics.
