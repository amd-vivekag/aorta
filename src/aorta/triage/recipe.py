"""Recipe schema, loader, and flag-mode builder for `aorta triage run`.

The recipe is the authoritative description of a triage matrix invocation:
which cells to run (cartesian or hand-picked mitigation x environment pairs),
per-cell trial / step counts, the ticket the matrix belongs to, and the
speed-confound detection config.

Two entry points converge on the same `Recipe` dataclass:

* :func:`load_recipe` - parses a YAML or JSON recipe file.
* :func:`build_recipe_from_flags` - constructs an in-memory `Recipe` from the
  CLI flag shim (``aorta triage run --mode matrix --mitigation-axis ... --environment-axis ...``).

The runner consumes a validated `Recipe` and does not branch on the origin
of it - both paths produce the same structure.

Schema version: 1. Unknown ``schema_version`` values raise
:class:`RecipeSchemaError` with a clear message.

    name-resolution, schema validation, and inline-docker normalization has
    succeeded, so downstream code can assume every cell references a name
    that will resolve at runtime.

    Attributes:
        schema_version: Always ``1`` for this build.
        workload: Workload name (resolved via ``aorta.workloads`` entry-point
            group at runtime by B1).
        trials: Recipe-level trial count. Cells override via ``cell.trials``.
        steps: Recipe-level step count. Cells override via ``cell.steps``.
        cells: Tuple of :class:`Cell` rows, in the order they appear in the
            source (preserved for matrix.md row ordering).
        ticket: Optional ticket ID; drives output-dir grouping. ``None`` is
            routed to ``_no_ticket_`` at write time.
        confound: Speed-confound detection configuration.
        inline_environments: Auto-registered inline envs referenced by cells.
            The runner writes a temporary sidecar JSON containing these so
            B1's ``get_environment`` resolves the auto-names.
        sidecar_files: Operator-supplied ``--mitigations-file`` paths that
            were used to validate this recipe's names. Carried on the
            ``Recipe`` so a programmatic ``load_recipe(path,
            sidecar_files=...) -> run_recipe(recipe)`` flow works without
            the caller threading sidecars through twice. The runner unions

            snapshots each path into ``<run_dir>/sidecars/<basename>`` for
            replay. Empty tuple when no sidecars were supplied.
        source_path: Path of the source file if loaded from disk (None for
            flag-mode). Surfaced in ``matrix.md``.
        source_sha256: SHA-256 of the source file text (None for flag-mode).
            Surfaced in ``matrix.md`` for reproducibility.
        workload_config: Recipe-scope ``dict[str, Any]`` applied to every
            cell as the base ``Request.config_overrides``. Per-cell
            ``Cell.workload_config`` merges over this on a per-key basis
