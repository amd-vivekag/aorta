"""Contingency-table data structure and per-cell aggregation for triage matrices.

Consumes B1's :class:`aorta.run.TrialResult` list for a single cell and emits
a :class:`CellStats` record with the fields the matrix.md table, confound
detection, and matrix.json all need.

Step-time source order (per cell, per trial):

1. ``trial.result["step_times_ms"]`` -- B1 surfaces the workload's
   ``WorkloadResult.step_times_ms`` list here. Preferred signal for
   confound detection since it comes from the workload's own clocks.
   Tagged ``"per_step"``.
2. ``trial.result["elapsed_sec"] / trial.result["total_iterations"] * 1000``
   -- fallback when the workload didn't provide per-iteration step times.
   Tagged ``"elapsed_per_iter"``.
3. ``trial.wall_clock_sec / <steps>`` when both of the above are absent
   (happens for workloads that fail in ``setup()`` before they compute any
   timing at all); attributed to the cell's resolved step count. Folds
   setup / teardown into the per-step number, so the figure is honest about
   total time but **not** a clean iteration-rate signal. Tagged
   ``"wall_clock_total"``.

The chosen branch is recorded on :class:`CellStats` as ``step_time_source``
and persisted in matrix.json so confound classification can refuse to
compare cells whose timing came from different fallback levels (mixing
"per_step" against "wall_clock_total" is comparing different kinds of
numbers; see :func:`aorta.triage.confound.classify`).

A trial is counted as a failure (``failed_count += 1``) if either its
``exit_status != "ok"`` OR the wrapped ``WorkloadResult.passed`` is False.
The aggregator does NOT inspect *why* a trial failed (NaN vs corruption vs
divergence vs infrastructure crash); that's :class:`WorkloadResult` /
``exit_status`` territory and is preserved separately via the
``exit_status_counts`` histogram so callers can distinguish e.g.
``workload_failed`` from ``infrastructure_failed`` when triaging.

class CellStats:
    """Aggregated statistics for one matrix cell.

    ``error`` is non-None when the whole cell failed (docker pull failure,
    environment resolve error, etc.) -- the matrix row is preserved so the
    matrix is complete but all numeric fields are zero / NaN.

    ``step_times_ms`` is the concatenation of every trial's step-time
    samples. Kept on the dataclass so matrix.json can embed the raw series
    for downstream analysis; matrix.md shows only the mean. The min / max /
    p50 / p90 / p99 fields summarise this series for the matrix.json
    consumer without forcing them to recompute.

    ``exit_status_counts`` is a histogram keyed by ``TrialResult.exit_status``
    (``"ok"``, ``"workload_failed"``, ``"infrastructure_failed"``, ...). It
    lets matrix.json consumers distinguish failure modes that ``failure_rate``
    alone collapses into a single number.

    ``step_time_source`` records which branch of the fallback ladder
    populated ``step_times_ms`` -- ``"per_step"``, ``"elapsed_per_iter"``,
    ``"wall_clock_total"``, or ``"missing"``. When trials in the same cell
    used different branches the cell-level value is the worst (lowest
    fidelity) source any trial fell back to. Confound classification reads
    this field to refuse cell-vs-baseline ratios whose numerators and
    denominators were derived from incomparable signals (issue #160 /
    Sonbol's review on PR #160).

    ``failure_hints`` is the deduplicated list of one-line ``hint`` strings
    pulled from each trial's ``result["failure_details"][*]["hint"]``, paired
    with how many trials in the cell emitted that exact hint. The aggregator
    treats the hint as opaque text -- the workload owns the contract.
    Trials with no ``failure_details`` or no ``hint`` key contribute nothing.
    Order of appearance is preserved (first hint seen comes first) so the
    matrix.md renderer is stable across runs with the same trial order.

    ``outcome_counts`` is a histogram across the cell's trials over the
    platform-level outcome enum (``did_not_run``,
    ``crashed_after_iterations``, ``completed``, ``unknown``). Always
    populated (one entry per trial) for non-error cells: legacy
    success-path trials land in ``unknown``; trials that the platform-
    side inference (``_looks_like_did_not_run``) flags land in
    ``did_not_run`` even when the workload doesn't speak the new
    ``main_work_started`` contract; new-contract trials hit the explicit
    branches. Error cells (``error is not None``) report ``{}`` because
    no trials were aggregated.

    ``executed_iter_min`` / ``executed_iter_max`` summarise how far the
    cell's trials actually got; ``configured_iters`` records the
    workload-reported denominator. ``iters_display`` is the pre-rendered
    cell value for matrix.md's "Iters" column (e.g. ``"0/50"``,
    ``"199..200/200"``, ``"?/?"`` if trials disagreed on the configured
    count, or ``"—"`` when the workload didn't track iterations).

    ``workload_config`` is the per-cell ``Request.config_overrides`` dict
    (the merge of ``recipe.workload_config`` and ``cell.workload_config``,
    cell wins on collision). Persisted in matrix.json so the report
    renderer can surface workload-knob differences (e.g.
    ``shampoo_api=old``) in the matrix.md ``Config`` column. Empty dict
    when the recipe omits the field for every cell -- behaviourally
    identical to the pre-B2.2 schema.
