"""Triage-matrix orchestration.

:func:`run_recipe` is the single entry point both the recipe-file mode and
the flag-mode CLI funnel into. Given a validated :class:`Recipe`, it:

1. Resolves the per-run output directory
   (``<output-dir>/<ticket>/<workload>/<timestamp>``) and creates it.
2. Writes an inline-docker sidecar JSON (if the recipe references any
   ``_inline_<hash>`` envs) so B1's registry resolver picks them up.
3. Captures the host :func:`aorta.instrumentation.environment.collect_env`
   snapshot once -> ``host_env.json``.
4. For each unique environment in ``recipe.cells``, captures a
   per-environment ``collect_env`` snapshot once, *right before that env's
   first cell runs* -> ``environments/<name>/env.json``.
5. Builds a :class:`aorta.run.RunRequest` per cell and calls
   :func:`aorta.run.run_trials` **in-process**. Per-cell exceptions are
   caught and surfaced as an ``error`` row so other cells still run.
6. Aggregates each cell via :func:`aorta.triage.matrix.aggregate_cell`.
7. Resolves the baseline cell and classifies every cell via
   :mod:`aorta.triage.confound`.
8. Writes ``matrix.md``, ``matrix.json``, ``recipe.resolved.yaml``.

Per the acceptance criteria in issue #151, this module MUST NOT use
``subprocess`` -- every cell runs as a plain Python call to
:func:`run_trials`. A grep-test under ``tests/triage/`` enforces that.
