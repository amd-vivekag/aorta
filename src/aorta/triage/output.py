"""Output layout + writers for the triage matrix.

Three artifacts per run, all in the same ``<output-dir>/<ticket>/<workload>/
<run-timestamp>/`` directory:

* ``matrix.md`` -- human-readable table matching the §"matrix.md target
  format" block in issue #151.
* ``matrix.json`` -- full machine-readable per-cell data: step-time stats,
  the env-var bundle as actually applied (``resolved_env_vars``), the
  resolved :class:`aorta.registry.Environment` descriptor
  (``resolved_environment``), trial JSON paths, exit-status histogram, and
  cell-level errors.
* ``recipe.resolved.yaml`` -- a strict, reloadable recipe snapshot. **Named
  mitigations and environments are deliberately NOT expanded** -- the file
  is the rerunnable artifact, not a drift-pinning artifact. Inline-docker
  cells are re-emitted as ``{docker: <ref>}`` so the same ``_inline_<hash>``
  is re-derived without a sidecar; named registry entries stay by name.
  See :func:`write_resolved_recipe` for the rationale and ``recipes/README.md``
  for replay caveats. To detect registry drift across runs, compare each
  run's ``matrix.json::cells[*].resolved_env_vars``.

Sibling files / directories (written by :mod:`aorta.triage.runner`):

* ``host_env.json`` -- one collect_env() snapshot taken at runner start.
* ``environments/<env-name>/env.json`` -- one collect_env() snapshot per
  unique environment, captured right before that env's first cell runs.
* ``cells/<cell-name>/`` -- B1's per-trial JSON output for that cell.
* ``sidecars/<basename>`` -- byte-identical copy of every operator-supplied
  ``--mitigations-file`` so the run dir is self-contained for replay.
