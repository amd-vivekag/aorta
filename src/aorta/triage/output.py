"""Output layout + writers for the triage matrix.

Three artifacts per run, all in the same ``<output-dir>/<ticket>/<workload>/
<run-timestamp>/`` directory:

* ``matrix.md`` -- human-readable table matching the §"matrix.md target
  format" block in issue #151.
* ``matrix.json`` -- full machine-readable per-cell data: step-time stats,
  the env-var bundle as actually applied (``resolved_env_vars``), the
  resolved :class:`aorta.registry.Environment` descriptor
  (``resolved_environment``), trial JSON paths, exit-status histogram, and
  cell-level errors.
* ``recipe.resolved.yaml`` -- a strict, reloadable recipe snapshot. **Named
  mitigations and environments are deliberately NOT expanded** -- the file
  is the rerunnable artifact, not a drift-pinning artifact. Inline-docker
  cells are re-emitted as ``{docker: <ref>}`` so the same ``_inline_<hash>``
  is re-derived without a sidecar; named registry entries stay by name.
  See :func:`write_resolved_recipe` for the rationale and ``recipes/README.md``
  for replay caveats. To detect registry drift across runs, compare each
  run's ``matrix.json::cells[*].resolved_env_vars``.

Sibling files / directories (written by :mod:`aorta.triage.runner`):

* ``host_env.json`` -- one collect_env() snapshot taken at runner start.
* ``environments/<env-name>/env.json`` -- one collect_env() snapshot per
  unique environment, captured right before that env's first cell runs.
* ``cells/<cell-name>/`` -- B1's per-trial JSON output for that cell.
* ``sidecars/<basename>`` -- byte-identical copy of every operator-supplied
  ``--mitigations-file`` so the run dir is self-contained for replay.

    ``flat_resume`` reuses a stable ``<output>/<ticket>/`` leaf across
    invocations (intentional, so per-trial ``result.json`` files can be
    detected as already-complete). That same property means two concurrent
    ``aorta probe`` invocations against the same ``--output`` /
    ``--ticket`` would race on ``matrix.json``, ``matrix.md``, and per-cell
    artifacts.

    On entry we ``O_CREAT|O_EXCL`` a small JSON file holding our PID, host,
    and start timestamp. If the file already exists we read it and decide:

    * Same host **and** ``os.kill(pid, 0)`` succeeds -> raise
      :class:`RunDirLockedError`. The other writer is genuinely live;
      stomping their tree would corrupt both runs.
    * Same host **and** PID is dead -> stale lock from a crashed prior
      run. Log a warning, overwrite, and proceed (this is the recovery
      path -- it's the whole reason ``flat_resume`` exists).
    * Different host -> we have no way to verify liveness across hosts.
      Fail closed: raise :class:`RunDirLockedError` and ask the operator
      to remove the lockfile explicitly. (Shared NFS with concurrent
      multi-host writers is the worst case; rather than guess we surface
      the situation.)
    * Lockfile present but unparseable -> treat as stale (a partial write
      from a crashed prior run); warn + overwrite. The alternative is to
      wedge resume indefinitely on a corrupt lock file.

    On context exit the lockfile is best-effort removed; failure to
    remove (e.g. the run dir was deleted under us) does not raise so the
    caller's own exit path isn't masked.

    Limitations (deliberately documented rather than papered over):

    * Advisory only -- a non-aorta writer (or an aorta version predating
      this lock) into the same tree is undetected.
    * Same-host liveness is checked via PID; PID reuse on busy hosts
      with very long-running operator sessions is theoretically possible
      but unlikely within a probe sweep's lifetime.
    * Cross-host NFS semantics for ``O_EXCL`` are
      filesystem-implementation-dependent. We don't rely on the
      atomicity of the cross-host case; the same-host PID check is the
      load-bearing guarantee. Operators running concurrent multi-host
      probes against the same tree should not (Phase-1 scope).

    top-level ``inline_environments`` key. The "resolved" property comes from
    inline-docker cells being re-emitted in the ``{docker: <ref>}`` shorthand
    form (so re-loading on another machine reproduces the same
    ``_inline_<hash>`` env without needing a sidecar JSON next to the file).

    Per-cell debug expansions (the ``Environment`` descriptor and the unioned
    mitigation env-var bundle) live in ``matrix.json`` instead, where they

    An active ``stop_after`` rule (issue #232) is re-emitted so a rerun from
    the resolved YAML preserves the stopping behaviour rather than silently
    reverting to fixed ``trials``.

    For runs that used ``--mitigations-file``, the resolved YAML still
    references those mitigation/environment names by name -- it is **not**
    self-contained on its own. The runner snapshots the operator-supplied

    The resolved YAML schema is intentionally kept strict (no metadata
    namespace) -- the README documents the replay command, and the runner
    echoes a one-line "to rerun:" hint on stdout when sidecars are present.
    ``sidecar_files`` is intentionally unused at write time; it is preserved
    on the signature so the runner can keep its single
