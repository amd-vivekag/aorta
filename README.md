# AORTA

GPU performance benchmarking and debugging toolkit for PyTorch workloads on AMD ROCm.

![Training Overlap Issue](analysis/figures/training_bad_overlap.png)

## What It Does

**FSDP2 Compute-Communication Overlap Analysis**
Debug why distributed training isn't overlapping compute with communication. Runs a synthetic transformer workload with explicit multi-stream execution, captures per-iteration timing, and generates overlap efficiency reports.

**Hardware Queue Evaluation**
Stress-test GPU queue scheduling with 8-64+ concurrent streams. Includes 15 workloads covering distributed training patterns (FSDP, MoE, activation checkpointing), inference (speculative decoding, continuous batching), and latency-sensitive scenarios (heterogeneous kernels, tiny kernel dispatch).

![hw_queue_cmds](docs/hw_queue_cmds.png)

**Environment Snapshot for Reproducibility**
Capture a versioned, schema-stable snapshot of the trial environment — ROCm / HIP / hipBLASLt / rocBLAS / MIOpen / RCCL identities, GPU arch, PyTorch build flags + cmake cache + per-target HIPCC defines, runtime SDPA backend state, ~30 numerics-relevant env vars — so cross-environment regressions become a `jq` diff instead of a multi-day investigation. Used standalone (`aorta env probe`) and embedded automatically into every trial result.


## Quick Start

```bash
# FSDP2 overlap benchmark
bash scripts/launch_rocm.sh config/default.yaml

# Hardware queue evaluation
python -m aorta.hw_queue_eval list                          # List workloads
python -m aorta.hw_queue_eval run hetero_kernels --streams 8
python -m aorta.hw_queue_eval sweep hetero_kernels --streams 1,2,4,8,16

# Comm-compute overlap (simulated collectives)
python -m aorta.hw_queue_eval run comms_compute_overlap --streams 4 --profile

# Comm-compute overlap (real NCCL collectives via torchrun)
torchrun --nproc_per_node=8 -m aorta.hw_queue_eval run comms_compute_overlap \
    --streams 4 --real-collectives --async-op --backend nccl \
    --process-groups "[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7]" --profile --profile-dir traces/

# Environment snapshot for reproducibility
aorta env probe -o env.json                               # full snapshot to disk
aorta env probe --summary                                 # one-screen brief, no file write
aorta env probe --field pytorch_build.git_commit          # one field, JSON-typed
diff <(jq -S . env_a.json) <(jq -S . env_b.json)          # diff two snapshots
```

## Example Analysis

AORTA generates comprehensive performance reports comparing ROCm versions across multiple configurations. See a [full example report](docs/comprehensive_report.html) comparing rocm-7.0.8-meta vs rocm-7.0.10-meta:

- **8 configurations tested**: 256/512 threads × 28/42/56/70 RCCL channels
- **96 visualizations**: Overlap ratios, GEMM throughput, NCCL metrics, timeline comparisons
- **Side-by-side diffs**: Identify regressions or improvements between driver/library versions

## Installation

We recommend using [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for fast, reliable Python environment management.

```bash
# Install uv (if not already installed)
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Create and activate a virtual environment
uv venv && source .venv/bin/activate

# Install PyTorch nightly for ROCm 7.1
uv pip install --pre torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/rocm7.1/

# Install remaining dependencies
uv pip install -r requirements.txt

# For full installation including hw_queue_eval
uv pip install -e ".[hw-queue]"
```

## Development

```bash
uv pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
pre-commit install
pytest tests/
```

*The FSDP2 overlap workloads also run on NVIDIA CUDA for side-by-side comparison with ROCm.*
