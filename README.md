# AORTA

GPU performance benchmarking and debugging toolkit for PyTorch workloads on AMD ROCm.

![Training Overlap Issue](analysis/figures/training_bad_overlap.png)

## What It Does

**FSDP2 Compute-Communication Overlap Analysis**
Debug why distributed training isn't overlapping compute with communication. Runs a synthetic transformer workload with explicit multi-stream execution, captures per-iteration timing, and generates overlap efficiency reports.

**Hardware Queue Evaluation**
Stress-test GPU queue scheduling with 8-64+ concurrent streams. Includes 15 workloads covering distributed training patterns (FSDP, MoE, activation checkpointing), inference (speculative decoding, continuous batching), and latency-sensitive scenarios (heterogeneous kernels, tiny kernel dispatch).

## Quick Start

```bash
# FSDP2 overlap benchmark
bash scripts/launch_rocm.sh config/default.yaml

# Hardware queue evaluation
python -m aorta.hw_queue_eval list                          # List workloads
python -m aorta.hw_queue_eval run hetero_kernels --streams 8
python -m aorta.hw_queue_eval sweep hetero_kernels --streams 1,2,4,8,16

# Comm-compute overlap (simulated collectives)
python -m aorta.hw_queue_eval run comms_compute_overlap --streams 4 --profile

# Comm-compute overlap (real NCCL collectives via torchrun)
torchrun --nproc_per_node=8 -m aorta.hw_queue_eval run comms_compute_overlap \
    --streams 4 --real-collectives --async-op --backend nccl \
    --process-groups "[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7]" --profile --profile-dir traces/
```

## Example Analysis

AORTA generates comprehensive performance reports comparing ROCm versions across multiple configurations. See a [full example report](docs/comprehensive_report.html) comparing rocm-7.0.8-meta vs rocm-7.0.10-meta:

- **8 configurations tested**: 256/512 threads × 28/42/56/70 RCCL channels
- **96 visualizations**: Overlap ratios, GEMM throughput, NCCL metrics, timeline comparisons
- **Side-by-side diffs**: Identify regressions or improvements between driver/library versions

## Installation

We recommend using [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for fast, reliable Python environment management.

```bash
# Install uv
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Clone and install all packages
git clone https://github.com/ROCm/aorta.git
cd aorta
uv sync --all-packages

# Install PyTorch nightly for ROCm 7.2
uv pip install --pre torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/rocm7.2/
```

### Install Individual Packages

```bash
# Install only the report tool
pip install "git+https://github.com/ROCm/aorta.git#subdirectory=packages/aorta-report"

# Install only the race detector
pip install "git+https://github.com/ROCm/aorta.git#subdirectory=packages/aorta-race"
```

## Development

```bash
uv sync --all-packages
pre-commit install
pytest tests/
```

*The FSDP2 overlap workloads also run on NVIDIA CUDA for side-by-side comparison with ROCm.*
