# AORTA

GPU performance benchmarking and debugging toolkit for PyTorch workloads on AMD ROCm.

![Training Overlap Issue](analysis/figures/training_bad_overlap.png)

## What It Does

**FSDP2 Compute-Communication Overlap Analysis**
Debug why distributed training isn't overlapping compute with communication. Runs a synthetic transformer workload with explicit multi-stream execution, captures per-iteration timing, and generates overlap efficiency reports.

**Hardware Queue Evaluation**
Stress-test GPU queue scheduling with 8-64+ concurrent streams. Includes 15 workloads covering distributed training patterns (FSDP, MoE, activation checkpointing), inference (speculative decoding, continuous batching), and latency-sensitive scenarios (heterogeneous kernels, tiny kernel dispatch).

## Quick Start

```bash
# FSDP2 overlap benchmark
bash scripts/launch_rocm.sh config/default.yaml

# Hardware queue evaluation
python -m aorta.hw_queue_eval list                          # List workloads
python -m aorta.hw_queue_eval run hetero_kernels --streams 8
python -m aorta.hw_queue_eval sweep hetero_kernels --streams 1,2,4,8,16
```

## Race Condition Testing

AORTA includes tools for reproducing and debugging CUDA/HIP stream race conditions in distributed training. Configure via the `race_experiment:` section:

```yaml
race_experiment:
  # Warmup control
  skip_training_warmup: false     # Skip forward/backward warmup
  training_warmup_steps: 1        # Steps if enabled
  skip_rccl_warmup: false         # Skip RCCL communicator warmup
  rccl_warmup_iterations: 10      # Iterations if enabled

  # Race injection (for debugging)
  h2d_memcpy_racing: false        # Race H2D memcpy with forward pass
  gpu_max_hw_queues: 4            # Set GPU_MAX_HW_QUEUES (4+ exposes races)
```

See [config/multi_node/shampoo_opt_multi_node.yaml](config/multi_node/shampoo_opt_multi_node.yaml) for full options.

## Example Analysis

AORTA generates comprehensive performance reports comparing ROCm versions across multiple configurations. See a [full example report](docs/comprehensive_report.html) comparing rocm-7.0.8-meta vs rocm-7.0.10-meta:

- **8 configurations tested**: 256/512 threads × 28/42/56/70 RCCL channels
- **96 visualizations**: Overlap ratios, GEMM throughput, NCCL metrics, timeline comparisons
- **Side-by-side diffs**: Identify regressions or improvements between driver/library versions
