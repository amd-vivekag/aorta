# AORTA

GPU performance benchmarking and debugging toolkit for PyTorch workloads on AMD ROCm.

![Training Overlap Issue](analysis/figures/training_bad_overlap.png)

## What It Does

**FSDP2 Compute-Communication Overlap Analysis**
Debug why distributed training isn't overlapping compute with communication. Runs a synthetic transformer workload with explicit multi-stream execution, captures per-iteration timing, and generates overlap efficiency reports.

![param_sweep](docs/param_sweep.png)

**Hardware Queue Evaluation**
Stress-test GPU queue scheduling with 8-64+ concurrent streams. Includes 15 workloads covering distributed training patterns (FSDP, MoE, activation checkpointing), inference (speculative decoding, continuous batching), and latency-sensitive scenarios (heterogeneous kernels, tiny kernel dispatch).

## Quick Start

```bash
# FSDP2 overlap benchmark
bash scripts/launch_rocm.sh config/default.yaml

# Hardware queue evaluation
python -m aorta.hw_queue_eval list                          # List workloads
python -m aorta.hw_queue_eval run hetero_kernels --streams 8
python -m aorta.hw_queue_eval sweep hetero_kernels --streams 1,2,4,8,16
```

## Example Analysis

AORTA generates comprehensive performance reports comparing ROCm versions across multiple configurations. See a [full example report](docs/comprehensive_report.html) comparing rocm-7.0.8-meta vs rocm-7.0.10-meta:

- **8 configurations tested**: 256/512 threads × 28/42/56/70 RCCL channels
- **96 visualizations**: Overlap ratios, GEMM throughput, NCCL metrics, timeline comparisons
- **Side-by-side diffs**: Identify regressions or improvements between driver/library versions

## Installation

We recommend using [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for fast, reliable Python environment management.

```bash
# Install uv (if not already installed)
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Create and activate a virtual environment
uv venv && source .venv/bin/activate

# Install PyTorch nightly for ROCm 7.1
uv pip install --pre torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/rocm7.1/

# Install remaining dependencies
uv pip install -r requirements.txt

# For full installation including hw_queue_eval
uv pip install -e ".[hw-queue]"
```

## Development

```bash
uv pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
pre-commit install
pytest tests/
```

*The FSDP2 overlap workloads also run on NVIDIA CUDA for side-by-side comparison with ROCm.*
