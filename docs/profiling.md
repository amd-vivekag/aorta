# Profiling Guide

This guide covers how to capture, analyze, and interpret profiling data from AORTA benchmark runs.

## Profiling Outputs

Each rank writes `artifacts/rank_<rank>_metrics.jsonl` containing iteration-level telemetry:

- Per-stream durations (ms) for compute, all-reduce, reduce-scatter, and auxiliary streams
- Overlap segments with concurrency statistics and utilisation ratios
- ROCm diagnostic output when enabled (rank-local)
- Loss, learning rate, gradient norms, and global step counters

Events are captured using `torch.cuda.Event(enable_timing=True)` for microsecond fidelity. Distributed collectives are monkey-patched at runtime so that all-reduce and reduce-scatter operations execute on dedicated streams and contribute to overlap calculation.

## Torch Profiler Traces

Enable PyTorch's profiler by toggling the `profiling` block in your config or via CLI override:

```bash
torchrun --nproc_per_node 4 train.py \
  --config config/default.yaml \
  --override profiling.enabled=true \
  --override profiling.wait=1 \
  --override profiling.warmup=1 \
  --override profiling.active=2
```

### Output Locations

- TensorBoard traces write to `artifacts/torch_profiler/rank*/` by default
- Launch `tensorboard --logdir artifacts/torch_profiler` and use the Profile tab for stream timelines

### Chrome Traces

- Enable via `profiling.chrome_trace=true`
- **Not recommended on ROCm** - the toolkit disables them automatically to avoid known Kineto crashes
- Adjust `wait`, `warmup`, `active`, and `repeat` to control capture cadence
- Shapes and memory statistics are recorded by default

## ROCm `rocprofv3` Capture

Use the wrapper script to profile an entire ROCm run:

```bash
bash scripts/rocprof_capture.sh config/default.yaml --override training.max_steps=50
```

### Output Location

Outputs land under `rocprof_traces/run_<timestamp>/`.

### Environment Variables

Override location or extra flags with environment variables:

- `ROCPROF_OUTPUT_DIR=/path/to/out`
- `ROCPROF_ARGS="--att --kernel-trace --kernel-symbols"`

The script mirrors `launch_rocm.sh` but executes through `rocprofv3`, so you can merge traces with the JSONL metrics using the shared iteration timestamps.

## Generating Reports

Run the analyser to build summaries and plots from one or more log directories:

```bash
python analysis/overlap_report.py \
  --log-dir artifacts_rocm --label rocm \
  --log-dir artifacts_cuda --label cuda \
  --output reports/2024-roc-vs-cuda \
  --reference cuda --candidate rocm
```

### Report Outputs

- `summary.json` - Aggregate metrics per dataset plus comparative ratios
- `{label}_timeline.png` - Overlays showing compute and overlap durations per global step

Use these artefacts to pinpoint scheduling or synchronisation regressions between hardware backends.

## Diagnostic Insights

![Overlap Ratio](../analysis/figures/overlap_ratio.png)

### Key Metrics

| Metric | Interpretation |
| --- | --- |
| **Overlap Ratio** (`overlap_ratio`) | Values close to 1 indicate strong overlap; values near 0 imply communications block compute |
| **Compute All-Reduce** (`compute_allreduce_ms`) | Time spent in all-reduce operations |
| **Compute Reduce-Scatter** (`compute_reducescatter_ms`) | Time spent in reduce-scatter operations |

### Analysis Tips

- Compare `compute_allreduce_ms` vs `compute_reducescatter_ms` to determine which collective dominates stall time
- Inspect `active_segments` in the JSONL logs to align iteration windows with external profilers (e.g., ROCm tracer)
- Cross-reference `rocm_smi_output` against overlap dips to correlate DVFS throttling or memory pressure with scheduling gaps

### Advanced Profiling

For deeper inspection, combine these scripts with `nsys`, `rocprof`, or PyTorch profiler traces using the iteration timestamps documented in the JSON traces.
